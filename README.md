This project (peepsofnith branch) was an attempt to build an alumni network for my alma mater. It turned out (for me personally) to be very bloated project with Meteor and MongoDB. I'm looking for other better options to go for and start this project from the scratch. If you come here from the future and want to help. I'll be available.
